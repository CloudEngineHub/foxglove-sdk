The official [Foxglove] SDK.

This crate provides support for integrating with the Foxglove platform. It can be used to log
events to local [MCAP] files or a local visualization server that communicates with the
Foxglove app.

# Supported Rust Versions

The current MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) is 1.85.0.

We aim to support Rust versions released within the past year. The MSRV may be
bumped in minor releases. Cargo's MSRV-aware resolver will automatically use an
older compatible version of this crate if your toolchain is older than the
current MSRV.
